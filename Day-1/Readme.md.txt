On the first day of the Skill Lab, we began with an insightful session covering foundational concepts in modern computing. Our instructor introduced key topics such as OS, Cloud Computing, Data Centers, Cloud Centers, and Cloud Providers, giving us a clear understanding of how modern infrastructure is structured and managed.

We then delved into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and explored different development models including the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. The transition from traditional models to DevOps was explained, highlighting the goals of DevOps and why it's essential in current software development practices.

After the theory session, we had a hands-on introduction to Linux commands, where we practiced basic but powerful commands such as ls, touch, cat, mkdir, cd, and pwd. This helped us gain familiarity with the Linux environment.

Finally, we discussed servers and their types, and learned about EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) configuration on AWS, getting a brief look at how cloud instances are set up and managed.
