On Day 3, we focused on understanding how Docker images are built using a Dockerfile. We created an image by copying only the necessary files—app.py and requirements.txt—into the image using the COPY instruction. We explored how WORKDIR, RUN, and CMD directives shape the container's behavior. After building the image with docker build -t my-image-name ., we verified its contents by running docker run -it <image-id> ls, which showed only the files we had explicitly added. This highlighted a key Docker concept: containers are isolated environments that only contain what we include during the build process.
