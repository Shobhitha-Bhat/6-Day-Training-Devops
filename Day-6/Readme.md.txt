On the final day of the Skill Lab, we explored Jenkins, a powerful automation tool used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The session introduced how to create and manage Jenkins jobs, both with and without integrating Git as a source code repository.

We also deployed applications using Apache Tomcat servers, demonstrating how Jenkins can be connected with Tomcat for automated deployment. The hands-on exercises included setting up multiple Jenkins jobs, configuring build steps, and triggering deploymentsâ€”some using Git integration, and others configured manually.

Additionally, we worked within the AWS environment, using EC2 instances to host Jenkins and Tomcat servers, providing practical exposure to deploying CI/CD pipelines in the cloud.
