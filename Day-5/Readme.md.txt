Day 5 of the Skill Lab centered around Linux file management and permissions. We explored different file types in Linux, such as directories (d) and regular files (-), and understood how the system handles them.

A major focus was on Linux file permissions, covering the User (owner), Group, and Others categories. We learned how to interpret and modify file permissions using the chmod command with numeric flags such as 770, 777, etc., to control access rights effectively.

Hands-on sessions included switching to the superuser (sudo su) in EC2 instances, enabling us to execute administrative commands and manage file systems securely on cloud-based Linux environments.
