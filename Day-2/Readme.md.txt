The second day of the Skill Lab focused on deepening our understanding of cloud infrastructure and scalability. We began by learning about the 3-Tier Architecture—presentation, application, and data layers—and how it forms the backbone of scalable and maintainable systems.

The session then covered the concepts of horizontal and vertical scaling, emphasizing how system performance can be improved by either increasing resources on a single machine or adding more machines to the setup.

We got hands-on experience with AWS services, including creating topics in Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and setting up subscriptions, demonstrating how messaging and notification systems work in the cloud.

Next, we explored Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)—its types (Application, Network, and Classic Load Balancers), and the key components that help distribute traffic efficiently across multiple instances.

Finally, we covered EC2 Auto Scaling, including the creation of launch templates and how to configure Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand. The integration of Load Balancing with Auto Scaling in AWS was demonstrated, showing how cloud systems can achieve high availability and fault tolerance.
